                  Katie Brumbach was born in the back of a circus wagon in the late 1880's to two Bavarian performers. After years of dazzling audiences with her jaw-dropping strength, one day in New York in 1902, Brumbach came across the World's Strongest Man, Eugene Sandow, and the two had an epic weightlifting showdown.
                </p>

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Brumbach definitively won when she lifted 300 pounds over her head with one hand, while Sandow barely got the weights to his chest with two hands.
                </p>

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Her victory proclamation? Changing her name to Katie Sandwina in honor of the man she defeated, Eugene Sandow. The Great Sandwina was born.
                </p>

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  We are inspired by her strength and her advocacy for women. In 1912, she became the vice president of the 800-member Suffragette Ladies of the Barnum & Bailey Circus and was sometimes referred to as Sandwina the Suffragette.

                  Katie Sandwina lifted others, fought for women's rights and lived a life deeply committed to equity. She is our inspiration to lift you.
