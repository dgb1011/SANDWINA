Summary
**Description:**

We're SANDWINA - a collective of certified career coaches on a mission to close the gender gap by making career coaching affordable and accessible for women. After 7 years of proven success, we're ready to rebuild our platform from the ground up.

**About the Project:**

We need an experienced Bubble developer to create a marketplace platform where women can discover coaches, book sessions, track progress, and access resources.

**Features We're Considering:**

**Core Features (Must-Have):**

- Multi-user platform (clients, coaches, admin roles)
- Coach profiles with bios, specialties, and availability
- Booking system (integrate with existing calendars or build native)
- Stripe payment processing (we already use Stripe)
- Client dashboard (upcoming sessions, resources, progress tracking)
- Coach dashboard (manage schedule, view clients, session notes)
- Admin panel (manage coaches, clients, platform oversight)
- Resource library (PDFs, videos, documents)
- Mobile-responsive design

**Additional Features (Advise on priority):**

- LiftMatcherÂ® quiz integration (we have existing Typeform quiz)
- Stripe Connect for automated payment splitting to coaches
- Community forum for clients
- Direct messaging between clients and coaches
- Email automation (reminders, follow-ups, re-engagement)

**Project Details:**

- **Pricing:** Provide estimates for three scenarios:
  - Option A: Core features only
  - Option B: Core + 2-3 additional features you recommend

- Strong communication skills and responsive to messages
- Available for dedicated engagement starting immediately

**To Apply, Include:**

1. **Portfolio:** 2-3 LIVE marketplace/booking platforms you've built in Bubble (links required)
2. **Scope recommendations:** Which features to prioritize for launch vs. Phase 2? Why?
3. **Three pricing scenarios:** Options A, B, C with price and timeline for each
4. **Technical approach:** Brief explanation for booking system, payment splitting, quiz integration

Mission: Close the gender gap faster by making career coaching affordable, approachable, and actionable

**What We're Looking For:**

A partner who:

- Understands marketplace dynamics and can advise on feature prioritization
- Thinks strategically about MVP vs. full-featured launch
- Communicates clearly and provides regular updates
- Can explain technical decisions in plain language
- Is excited about building technology that empowers women
- Will be honest about realistic timelines and budgets
- Takes pride in delivering quality work

**Decision-Making:**

We're open to your expert recommendation on what to build first. If you think certain "additional features" are critical for launch, make your case. We want strategic input, not just development work.

**Payment Structure:**

We prefer fixed-price milestone-based contracts. Provide your recommended milestone structure.

**Post-Launch:**

Include your hourly rate for post-launch support and feature additions.

**We're ready to move fast. If you're the right developer, we can start within days.**

**Applications with live portfolios, clear pricing scenarios, and strategic recommendations will be prioritized.**

Let's build something that changes lives. ðŸ’ª
